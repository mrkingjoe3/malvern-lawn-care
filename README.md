# malvern-lawn-care
This app is currently being desgined for Malvern Lawn Care, a lawn care/landsacping company owned by Ethan Seely based out of Malvern PA. 

My current goal is to have basic functionality. I want this app to track all his customers, employees, and work sites, and provide basic onformation about each. 

After this, I will work to provide real time location tracking for the employees. This will monitor how long each employee is at a job site for, allowing a sort of automated time clock.
